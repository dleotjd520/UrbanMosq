# Sample data
Example datasets for Waterside Habitats (WH) and Non-waterside Habitats (NH) are provided. Each dataset includes the date, mosquito abundance (ind.), and values for minimum temperature (Temp_min), maximum temperature (Temp_max), average temperature (Temp_av), precipitation (Prec), and number of precipitation days (Prec_day), calculated for cumulative periods from day 1 to day 30 (cum1–cum30).

# R code
The R code provided corresponds to the analytical methods applied in this study:
(1) Mosquito–Cumulative Meteorology Comparison (2D) for Figures 3–5,
(2) Mosquito–Cumulative Meteorology Comparison (3D surface plot) for Figure 6, and
(3) Convergent Cross Mapping for Figures 7 and S1.
